Using the StringBuilder class
  1) Add a toString() method to the emailAddress class that prints a list of "<EmailAddress.Type: {email address}>"
  2) return "\<no email address available\>" if there is none.
  3) Add unit tests to confirm (no email adresses, one email address, all three types of email addresses.)

     Include the EmailAddresses and
     Print the birthDate with a comma after the day, 'CE' after the year, and no time.
  4) Add unit tests for these
